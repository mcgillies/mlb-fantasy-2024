    "# Third Basemen\n",

    "See the third basemen rankings [here](https://github.com/mcgillies/mlb-fantasy-2025/blob/main/predictions/3B_ranks.csv)\n",

    "## Upper Echelon: Alex Bregman - HOU (My Rank: 13, ESPN: 38) AND Austin Riley - ATL (My Rank: 38, ESPN: 64)\n",
    "I will be coming out of my draft with one of these two at third base. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, Bregman. He is elite at making contact with a 13% K rate and an obscenely low 13% whiff rate. He also squares the ball up very well with a 96th percentile squared up rate. His metrics may not make you frolic around the kitchen, but he is another one of the \"pull for power\" types. The caveat: he just moved to Fenway Park and will be taking shots at the Green Monster all season. This should lead to a ton of extra base hits. The decrease in walk rate is slightly concerning (13% in 2023 to 7% in 2024), but this seems like an outlier given he has had a BB% > 11% for the prior seven seasons. He will also very likely gain 2B eligibility this season, barring Rafael Devers realizing he is an awful defender at third base. \n",

    "Similarly to Matt Olson, I expect a bounce back season from Austin Riley. He just mashes baseballs. In a down season last year he still was 90th percentile or above in the following metrics: xwOBA, xSLG, avg EV, Barrel%, Hard-Hit% and Bat Speed. He underachieved his estimators as well, with his SLG .40 points below his xSLG and wOBA .25 points below his xwOBA. He does strike out more and walk less than you would like, but his underlying stats mirror his 2022 and 2023 stats where he hit for a .877 and .861 OPS respectively. He also dealt with oblique injuries throughout the 2024 season, likely hampering his play. I'm taking Riley every day of the week, especially at this ESPN rank. \n",
