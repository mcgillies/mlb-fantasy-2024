# MLB Fantasy 2025 Analysis
Data taken from Baseball Savant. 

Intended for ESPN points leagues - to convert to other leagues just change the scoring calculation in [this file](data_cleaning/calc_fpoints.py).

Current full rankings [here](predictions/initial_all_preds.csv)

Current Hitter rankings [here](predictions/initial_batter_preds.csv)

Current pitcher rankings [here](predictions/initial_picher_preds.csv)

proj_fpoints_skill does not include "team" stats (Wins, Losses, Saves, Holds) while proj_fpoints does. For the "skill" based metric comparisons should only be made between pitchers of the same role (ie. relievers vs starters).
